# Counting all possible fan ships of GVH characters

Who *doesn't* love counting permutations and combinations?  The main document of interest is `shipping.pdf`, which describes how to count the number of fan ships for various scenarios (couples, fully interconnected polycules, and generalized polycules).

Also included are some programs for double-checking the math by brute-force counting the possibilities.  `shipping.py` provides a check for sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the document, and `shipping.c` provides a check for section 3.1.

Also included is `shipping.odt`, which includes an editable version of the document if anyone is interested in contributing.
